# DiscordBot ðŸ¤–
I use discord daily so it's time to get a deeper understanding of the software and API.
This bot will later be connected to my Runelite plugin(https://github.com/alexanderrost/Loot-Notifier) to display information from Runescape.


# Installation âœ…

Make sure you have pip installed, or you can also manually install: 
- discord.py
- lavalink
- wavelink
- mysql.connector

`pip install -U discord.py`

`pip install lavalink`

`pip install wavelink`

`pip install mysql.connector`


Java 11 - https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11

Download Lavalink - https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases

MySQL Workbench  - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Wavelink is used to connect to public nodes.
MySQL is used for testing and accessing the database.


You need to make sure that your Java path is configured correctly. Look up a video on how to do that.

# DiscordBot
I use discord daily so it's time to get a deeper understanding of the software and API.

-For the music functions we use lavalink. https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink

-```pip install discord```
-```pip install discord.py[voice]```
-```pip install wavelink```
-```pip install mysql.connector```
